    abstract = { It is shown that, when two superposed fluids of different densities are accelerated in a direction perpendicular to their interface, this surface is stable or unstable according to whether the acceleration is directed from the heavier to the lighter fluid or vice versa. The relationship between the rate of development of the instability and the length of wave-like disturbances, the acceleration and the densities is found, and similar calculations are made for the case when a sheet of liquid of uniform depth is accelerated. }

abstract = {This study presents experimental measurements and computational modelling of particle-laden jets for a wide range of Stokes numbers to analyse the effect of polydispersity on particle volume fraction and velocity. The polydisperse two-phase turbulent jet issues from a pipe into a low velocity coflow, resulting in inlet Stokes numbers, Stin, ranging from 0.003 to 25. The particle velocity and volume fraction are experimentally measured using digital particle image velocimetry and planar nephelometry simultaneously. The simulations are conducted using a newly developed model based on the probability density function of the population balance equation (PDF-PBE) in a large eddy simulation framework. A stochastic Monte Carlo method is adopted to solve the PDF-PBE on an ensemble of notional Lagrangian particles, while the method of Stokes binning is employed to explicitly treat inertial effects in a computationally efficient way. There is a satisfactory agreement between the measurements and simulations. A series of monodisperse simulations were also conducted to compare with the polydisperse flows in a two-way coupled flow. The results confirm that in the monodisperse jet, small particles (with Stin≤0.3) closely follow the carrier phase velocity whereas in the polydisperse jet they are affected by the presence of larger particles to reduce their axial velocity decay rate. The opposite trend is observed for large particles (Stin≥5.5), confirming that in the polydisperse jet, the presence of small particles increases the large particles’ radial dispersion that lowers their volume fraction along the centreline compared to the monodisperse jet.}

    abstract = "{In the present work, the particle-laden coaxial turbulent jet flow is studied using large-eddy simulation (LES). An Eulerian–Lagrangian framework is used to study the interaction between the continuous phase (air) and the discrete phase (glass bead particles). The solver is validated, using single-phase and particle-laden simulations, with reference data from experiments. A good match is observed between the present results and the reference data, for centerline velocity decay and radial profiles of axial velocity. Simulations are performed for three co-flow velocity ratios of 0, 1, and 1.5. The results pertaining to particle characteristics are presented for three different particle size-classes. The effect of the co-flow velocity ratio on the particle size–velocity correlation and velocity statistics of both phases are studied with an emphasis on understanding the differences in the particle dispersion due to co-flow around the central jet. It is observed that the particle size–velocity correlation is negative in the potential core region, and it becomes positive as one moves downstream. For heavy particles, the axial distance required to attain the same velocity as that of air increases with an increase in the co-flow velocity ratio. The size-conditioned particle number density profiles along the axial and radial directions of coaxial jets showed some interesting trends that could be explained based on the particle Stokes number effect. Significant radial dispersion of particles is realized when the corresponding Stokes number (StL), defined based on large-scale turbulent eddies, is of the order of one. The axial evolution of the characteristic particle size exhibited non-monotonic trends for all co-flow ratios. Overall, the present work demonstrates potential application of LES for an in-depth study of dispersion of poly-disperse particles in turbulent coaxial jets.}",
